<person>Suresh Raina</person> earned a promotion on his comeback but hardly did justice to the opportunity. His seven-ball manic stay in the middle involved a trademark hit over midwicket for a six, a big heave on the offside that the fielder nearly reached, but didn't and it trickled for a four, and another four over backward point. The flow and rhythm was back, but <person>Raina</person> pushed his luck while going for another aerial shot. <person>Junior Dala</person> called well and completed a catch off his own bowling to pick up his second scalp. Amidst all this, <person>Dhawan</person> kept scoring boundaries at will. <person>Dala</person> third over - and the last of the batting powerplay - saw the left-handed opener smash two fours and six, taking India to 78 for 2.
