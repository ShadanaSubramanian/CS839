Bowling coach <person>Charl Langeveldt</person> had bemoaned the performance of his opening bowlers in the series so far, giving them a five out of ten and suggesting that <person>Vernon Philander</person> was being thought of as an alternative. <person>Morris</person> responded positively to the challenge, dismissing <person>Tharanga</person> in his second over and <person>Kusal Mendis</person> in his third during an opening spell of 2 for 20 in five overs. After <person>Kagiso Rabada</person> started poorly, <person>Parnell</person> took up the slack and sent back <person>Niroshan Dickwella</person> (39) and <person>Sandun Weerakkody</person>, leaving Sri Lanka four down after just nine overs.
