The duo of <person>Warner</person> and <person>Maxwell</person> made a steady start before the latter made room and thumped <person>Suranga Lakmal</person> through the cover-region for a boundary. It is interesting to note that <person>Maxwell</person> has been sent up the order to open the batting. <person>Warner</person> then crunched <person>Kasun Rajitha</person> for four boundaries in the third over. The pitch looks flat and the tourists will fancy getting a substantial total.
