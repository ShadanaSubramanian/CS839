<person>Perera</person>, finally, ended the 132-run stand by picking up <person>Bailey's</person> wicket. The 33-year-old took the review for leg before, but the replays indicated that the ball had pitched in line and projected it to be clipping the leg-stump. As a result, Bailey had to make the walk back to the pavilion. <person>Travis Head</person> (13) didn't last long, and <person>Warner</person> himself lobbed a return catch back to <person>Dhananjaya de Silva</person> and was dismissed. By then, the outcome of the match was just a foregone conclusion and the visitors chased down the target in the 43rd over.
