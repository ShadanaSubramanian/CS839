Even as <person>de Silva</person> waged a lone battle, he was running out of partners at the other end as <person>Sachith Pathirana</person> also fell cheaply, handing a simple return catch to Hastings. While the No. 3 batsman went on to bring up a hard-fought half-century to help Sri Lanka past 100, the hosts were in danger of being bowled out before using up their full quota of 20 overs. <person>Prasanna</person>, who was involved in a 28-run stand with <person>de Silva</person>, became the eighth to head back to the hut when he failed in his attempt to take on <person>Faulkner</person>. The left-arm seamer also finished with a three-wicket haul, while conceding only 19 runs off his four overs.
