But <person>de Villiers</person> and <person>du Plessis</person> weren't normal. They were 'woeligs' - Afrikaans for restless busy-bodies. They were famed for their notoriety. <person>Faf</person> came to me one day and said he wouldn't be able to come to practice because his kit was locked in his hostel room and he'd lost his key, recollects <person>Botes</person>. "I told him: 'You know what <person>Faf</person>, I don't care what you do but you have to come to practice.' Discipline is very important, we are very strict. You cannot be captain of the side and miss a practice session. It's your bad management, you have to take control of your life.
