Apart from a hundred in the Test series, <person>Kohli<\person> did not have a productive time with the bat during the three Tests. Keen to right the wrong, he unleashed his mastery with the bat during the ODI series. Two hundreds and one half-century, two not outs, 330 runs at an average of 110, <person>Kohli<\person> was an unstoppable force during the five-match ODI series. And it didn't stop there. Before the lone T20I in this tour, <person>Kohli<\person> had been in prolific form in the shortest format against Sri Lanka, having scored 68, 77 and 56 in his last three outings against the team from the Island Nation. Adding another half-century to that streak, <person>Kohli<\person> continued his run-scoring spree against Sri Lanka with a enterprising knock that helped India wipe off the entire plate with nine victories in the tour.
