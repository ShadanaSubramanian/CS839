Great session for South Africa and they are on the verge of a fantastic win. At 30/0, defending only 207 and couple of <person>Vijay</person> decisions being overturned, things did not go South Africa's way, but they did not lose hope. With enough help from the pitch, they stuck to their lengths and eventually the breakthroughs came. <person>Morne</person> bounced out <person>Shikhar</person>, <person>Vija</person> looked very disorganised during his stay, <person>Pujara</person> got a peach, but <person>Kohli</person> and <person>Rohit</person> looked good for a fight. The bowlers lost a bit of gas and suddenly <person>de Kock</person> was collecting balls around his knee.
