<person>Dhananjay de Silva</person> (12) and <person>Kusal Perera</person> (11) looked out of sorts during their grind in the middle and failed to provide adequate support to <person>Chandimal</person>. Meanwhile, the well-set <person>Chandimal</person> received a reprieve when he was dropped by <person>Warner</person> at gully in the 22nd over. He was on 40 then and clearly intent on making the most of it. <person>Chandimal</person>, who had scored five half-centuries in his last six innings, finally touched the three-figure mark in the 49th over. He kept the team afloat even after they were reduced to 178 for 8, before being dismissed in the final over.
