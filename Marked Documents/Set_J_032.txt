<person>Sunil Gavaskar</person>: If India can restrict South Africa for less than 300 (including the lead), they have a chance. Anything more than means trouble for India. <person>Bhuvneshwar</person> has bowled well but <person>Shami</person> hasn't come good. India got to have smart field placements and let the batsmen get those boundaries with very good shots. You got to say, it's loaded in favor of South Africa. <person>Hardik Pandya</person>: "I had a pretty good day. First Test match, wanted to bat a lot and got the opportunity to help our team out from a difficult situation. It always feels good and feels proud as well. From the situation we came in, credit goes to <person>Bhuvi</person> as well. We almost got a hundred run partnership. I am someone who likes to play according to the situation and I always believe in that. When I got in there <person>Ashwin</person> was playing, so I had to play with him, you know. When we lost two quick wickets I made sure we need to score runs as well. It was clear in my mind how I have to counter-attack. To be honest I never play for my own individual scores, you should always play for the team. (Talking about <person>Rabada</person>) It's nice to have someone who likes to surprise you. I like to be aggressive and I like to give it back as well. It's challenging to face him. Rabada is a wonderful bowler and I respect him. It's a nice competition to have. It shouldn't be easy."
