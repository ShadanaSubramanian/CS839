South African mainstays - <person>Hashim Amla</person>, <person>AB de Villiers</person> and F<person>af du Plessis</person> would be looking forward to extend that lead over 250 if not more, in order to give their bowlers that freedom to attack in the fourth innings. Talking about India, their bowlers did manage to bundle out hosts in the first innings but leaked runs and there were a few dropped catches at the same time. However, if the fielders cling on to their catches and convert those half chances, India surely can make a match out of this. So, sit back, relax and enjoy this Test folks. Some exciting Test cricket is on the cards! Day 4: Opening day of the Test was dominated by some serious swing and pace; <person>Hardik Pandya</person> sparked some magic in the match on the second day whereas rain took centre stage on the third. Well, this game has moved ahead at a rapid pace but one complete day getting washed out means, all three results are now possible. Yes, so uncertain is cricket and that is why we absolutely love this sport, isn't it? Proteas were miles ahead in the match at the end of day 2 but <person>Dale Steyn</person> injury and the rain interlude yesterday might have given a sigh of relief and a ray of hope to the number 1 ranked Test team of the world. By no means are they out of this contest and if they play to their potential, they do have a chance to win this match.
