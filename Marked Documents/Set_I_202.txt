That, at least, suggests that the tour is serving some use to Sri Lanka as they look for bright young batsmen who can fill the top and middle order for some time to come. Contributions from <person>Kusal Mendis</person> and <person>Dhananjaya de Silva</person> in the fifth ODI would give the selectors a good idea of what their batting line-up might look like for the Champions Trophy in England.
