<person>Aiden Markram</person>, winning skipper: Pink seems to be the perfect potion for us. Just relieved to have got over the line today. To put some pressure on the Indians is a good feeling and to win is even better. Definitely happy with the fightback; the break out there was a blessing in disguise to break up their momentum. The bowlers too were able to work out their plans in that break. To restrict them to 290 was a great job from our bowlers. The message before today was to put fear aside and go and express ourselves and it is nice to see boys having bought into the plan. There is enough pressure in this game and you don't want boys to put pressure on themselves. It is good to have some experience in our middle-order with <person>AB</person> coming back. He possesses a different proposition to the opposition as well. We need to keep fighting our way; we aren't still at our best yet and need to keep improving with each game with one step at a time. Would love to take pink into our big tournaments as well (laughs). Great day, great initiative and just incredibly happy with the way the day went.<person>Heinrich Klaasen</person>, Man of the Match: Unbelievable feeling; it is the best I've felt in my career so far. I was 100-percent nervous walking into the crease, my heart was beating very loudly. I have done it in the past though at the domestic level. I just want to play, doesn't matter where I bat. I was told that I would be opening, but was drafted down to number six and thank God for that. Sometimes you have to try playing innovative shots and am glad it came off tonight.
