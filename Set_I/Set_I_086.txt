The partnership was a superb blend of aggression and solidity, with <person>de Kock</person> and <person>Amla</person> playing their usual roles, much to the frustration of the visiting team's bowlers, who were running out of ideas as the opening pair extended the partnership past 150 in 22 overs. <person>De Kock</person>, who had earlier crossed 3000 runs, becoming the third fastest South African and the fastest wicketkeeper-batsman to do so, reached the three-figure mark with a four off <person>Asela Gunaratne</person> before the half-way stage of the innings. A four off the same bowler in the same over, was the 16th and the last of <person>de Kock</person>'s hits to the fence as the left-hander failed in his attempt to go hit <person>Suranga Lakmal</person> over extra cover, much to the relief of Sri Lanka.
