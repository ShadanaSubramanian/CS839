The conditions we (will) play in now will be quite similar to what we get during IPL, so we want to cash in on that aggression," <person>Dhoni</person> said about <person>Raina's</person> batting position and role in the order."I think we have the right mix. And <person>Yuvraj</person> can just go and express himself batting at No.5. There will be less pressure on him. And as he plays more and more games, he'll just open up more."
