<person>Rabada</person> to <person>Saha</person>, out Lbw!! <person>Rabada</person> gets <person>Saha</person> with the last ball before tea. South Africa are elated. Fullish delivery swinging back in, <person>Saha</person> doesn't have the technique to survive swing, the ball thuds into the front pad, impact on middle. Umpire <person>Richard Kettleborough</person> thought and then raised the finger. Looked OUT to the naked eye. India reviewed and the ball-tracker said it would have just brushed the leg stump. <person>Saha</person> lbw b <person>Rabada</person> 8(19). <person>De Kock</person> went up for a catch, looked close but there was no bat involved. South Africa don't review. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, <person>Saha</person> tries to fend, but the ball moves away to beat him
