What an assured feeling it is for the bowlers when <person>MS Dhoni</person> is behind the stumps, especially the spinners. When <person>Angelo Mathews</person> was beaten by <person>Chahal</person> outside off, his back foot was flirting with the crease as <person>Dhoni</person> 'The Flash' brought down the bails. While <person>Mathews</person> did not appear too concerned, thinking that he was comfortably back, <person>Dhoni</person> attempting a stumping isn't something that can be taken lightly, and the former Sri Lanka captain realised exactly that a short while later.
