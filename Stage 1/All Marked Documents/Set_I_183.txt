<person>Virat Kohli</person>, losing skipper: In the second innings when the game was placed after the interval, we got a difference of 35 between runs and balls, it was almost a T20 game. We had to take our chances, no balls aren't easy. In hindsight you have to give credit to South Africa, we didn't grab our chances and they deserved to win. After the first lightning break when <person>Shikhar</person> and <person>Jinks</person> came off, the guys felt that the wicket got faster and the weather got cooler and they felt that the ball wasn't coming on nicely. The ball was getting a little wet, our spinners got a bit of turn but the South African batsmen took their chances and they came off. They improvised well and they deserved to win. The game getting shorter worked in their favour; had it been a full game you never know. It was more like a T20 game and you have to go after the bowlers. If a side has momentum in their favour, it is very difficult to stop them. Especially guys like <person>Miller</person> and their keeper batted brilliantly as well. When <person>AB</person> got out we felt we were in the game but these two took it away from us. No balls are something that hurts you as a team and it is something we hope to rectify and not repeat them in the next games. They are a quality side and we know that. We also know that we have to be at the top of our game to get a win and that's what we'll do for the next game.
