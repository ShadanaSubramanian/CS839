<person>Hardik Pandya</person> blond streak looks like a burning flame above the forehead. Chances are it could well be the tip of the raging fire that burns in his belly. On a pitch where the teams more-accomplished batsmen struggled, in a country where the celebrated past-masters have been humbled, <person>Pandya</person> showed that cricket was kind to those with a stout heart," Indian Express' <person>Sandeep Dwivedi</person> yet again proves his romantic relationship with words.Writing for the Supersport website, <person>Anand Vasu</person> was all praise for the Baroda lad. "Driving off the front and back foot through the off side and punching gloriously off the back foot, <person>Pandya</person> batted with a control and fluency that none of the batsmen who came before him could achieve."The news portals have been flooded with <person>Hardik</person> heroic knock, <person>Steyn</person> injury and India's comeback of course. Here are our picks...Back to cricket, South Africa have a lead of 142. <person>Amla</person> at the crease. <person>Faf</person> and <person>AB</person> yet to come, so there's no leeway for the Indian bowlers. They have to be spot-on from ball one; have to emulate <person>Philander</person> consistency and <person>Steyn</person> aggro. Can they do it? We will know in a while....#Day 3: It was supposed to be steaming. The fire and fierce of Test match cricket ought to take the center stage, but I'm afraid - as most of you must be aware by now - I have some worrisome news to mark the build-up of this hackneyed 'moving day' in Cape Town. <person>Dale Steyn</person>, after suffering a bruised heel in the second session yesterday, is all but likely to miss the rest of the series meaning he won't bowl any further in this game and will only bat if required. So, India have something to cheer about after the redemption on day two where swing and seam ruled the roost. The ball swung, and so did a certain 'SG' bat. Funky, sleeky, spazzy. Not many approved of his all-round abilities in sub-continent forget the foreign conditions but boy, did he bash purist theories upside down! <person>Hardik Pandya</person> flayed, edged, copped a few blows, swung like a pendulum at the crease, but all that while he carried a purpose, a strong determined one at that; to score as many runs as possible. It would be unfair to endorse him as the next superstar which would only add insurmountable pressure to his 'teeny-outrageously-talented' tag.
