"We need to address some situations later in the change room. The bowlers bowled well, <person>Zampa</person> used the breeze well, but to be brutally honest we should have won it 5 wickets left. Our top order hasn't been firing, I put my hand up as well, but yeah happy to take a 2-1 lead." - <person>David Warner</person>.
This has been a fascinating innings from <person>Dinesh Chandimal</person> even as his teammates folded at the first sight of adversity.
