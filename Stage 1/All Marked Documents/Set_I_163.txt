While almost everything that they tried went right for India, this was a series that South Africa would like to forget quickly. Little went right for them and the injuries to key players added to their misery. They started the series with their best batsman <person>AB de Villiers</person> ruled out for the first half of the series and lost <person>de Kock</person> and <person>du Plessis</person> by the time <person>de Villiers</person> returned. Young <person>Markram</person> was thrust upon with captaincy, with an experience of just two ODI caps. The result was a 1-5 loss - the second time they lost five matches in a home series and first since the loss by the same margin against <person>Ricky Ponting</person> Australia in 2002.
