But what a cracker! Australia just about doing enough in the run-chase. They stuttered early, threatened to fall apart, but some superb manouevering of spin by <person>Bailey</person> in crucial partnerships with <person>Head</person> and <person>Wade</person> led the recovery. It nearly dropped Australia to the doorstep of victory, but they threatened to blow it up once again towards the end when a lower-order collapse seemed on the cards. Did enough though. <person>Starc's</person> blows helped. And here they are, leading 2-1 in the series.
