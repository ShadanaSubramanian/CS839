When <person>Kohli</person> took over the limited-overs captaincy in a full-time capacity at the start of the year, he had admitted that there were a few concerns with the Indian middle order and that <person>Yuvraj Singh</person> was brought into the side to bridge the gap and not leave <person>MS Dhoni</person> with the burden of having to shepherd the middle order. If the top order clicked things went swimmingly for India but when they failed, the problems came to the fore as was the case in the Champions Trophy final against Pakistan and the solitary loss to West Indies in the five-match series that followed. In order to fix these issues and plan for the next tournament it was decided that players would not be allowed to get comfortable with their familiar positions but be tried at different spots and provided with sufficient time to get used to playing different roles.
