<person>Shami</person> to <person>Maharaj</person>, out <person>Maharaj</person> Run Out!! <person>Ashwin</person> has his name in the wickets column, although it won't count against his name, he will feel happy to have contributed in nipping out a wicket. The Indian bowlers have been serving some short stuff in the last few overs and that sort of unsettled <person>Keshav Maharaj</person> and he tried to get out of jail with a quick single. He tapped the ball to mid-on and called his partner through...the latter though wasn't keen and sent him back instantly. <person>Maharaj</person> was too far down and didn't attempt a dive either. <person>Ashwin</person> throw, albeit slow, was accurate and he catches <person>Maharaj</person> inches short. Much needed wicket this for India.
<person>Shami</person> to <person>Maharaj</person>, no run, that's the one he bowled to <person>Philander</person>. Lands it on a length and gets the ball to nip back in to beat <person>Maharaj</person> on the inside edge. <person>Maharaj</person> wasn't fully forward, neither backward; caught in the crease, the bat didn't come down either. Shaves the bails, well almost...
