<person>Kuldeep Yadav</person> to <person>Morne Morkel</person>, 1 run. What's happening! Firstly, <person>Kedar Jadhav</person> dropped a catch at mid-on. And, then there's a query for run-out. The TV umpire is called. Safe! NOT OUT flashed on the giant screen. <person>Morkel</person> intent is clear. Decides to go over mid-on first ball, by clearing his front leg. Gets it off the cue end and <person>Kedar</person> put down a chance after moving to his left. <person>Chris Morris</person> wanted the single and <person>Morkel</person> was late to respond. A direct hit would have been curtains for the tall fellow. By the time, the bowler collected and dislodged the bails, <person>Morkel</person> made his ground with a dive <person>Morne Morkel</person>, left handed bat, comes to the crease. <person>Kuldeep Yadav</person> to <person>Rabada</person>, out Lbw!! The wrist spinners are running riot here at Centurion. The googly does the trick. <person>Rabada</person> didn't pick that. He was playing for the away-turner and hence played down the wrong line. Skid off the pitch and pinged <person>Rabada</person> in front of middle and leg. India went up right away and umpire <person>Aleem Dar</person> was quick to raise the dreaded finger. They shared five between them in Durban. Six already, here.
