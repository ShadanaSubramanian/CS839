Australia's score of 99 for 4 could have well been 99 for 5 had <person>Prasanna</person> and <person>Kusal Perera</person> not put down tough chances offered by <person>Usman Khawaja</person>. A watchful partnership between <person>Khawaja</person> and <person>Matthew Wade</person> ensued as Australia got closer to the target. To make things more interesting, <person>Dilshan</person> trapped <person>Khawaja</person> in front in the 15th over and struck again in the 17th to send back <person>Matthew Wade</person>.
