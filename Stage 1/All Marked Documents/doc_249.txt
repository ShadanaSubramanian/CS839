India's spinners finally came to the fore during the Australian tour as <person>Ravindra Jadeja</person> and <person>Ravichandran Ashwin</person> combined well to break the back of Australia's chase and give the visitors a winning start in the three-game Twenty20 International (T20I) series in Adelaide. India won by 37 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the series. <person>Raina</person> fell in the final over, having scored 41 off 34, but the remaining four balls gave <person>Dhoni</person> his chance to swing wildly. He unleashed the helicopter shot for a maximum off the first ball he faced and then cut a wide delivery for four off the next as India ended with a sizeable total which proved to be 37 too many for the hosts.
