The worry for India though is that there's hardly anything on offer to be put away and the bowling has been top quality. And they can't afford to take risks and get out, which will only invite more ridicule and criticism. With four seamers, and all of them world class, South Africa hold all the aces. Here comes the young tyro - <person>Kagiso Rabada</person> who will look to break this stand. He will start after the drinks break...Just the 17 runs scored in the 13 overs bowled today. <person>Philander</person> bowling five maiden overs in a row and landing it perfectly almost every ball. Test of fire this for <person>Pujara</person> and <person>Rohit</person> and they have done well to come out of the hour of play unscathed. There were plays and misses from <person>Rohit</person> against <person>Philander</person>, but he has shown good technique and more importantly character and application to see off the opening bursts from <person>Steyn</person> and <person>Philander</person>. <person>Pujara</person> on the other hand has looked solid and despite being tested by <person>Steyn</person> short ball barrage didn't flinch.
