12:27 Local Time, 10:27 GMT, 15:57 IST: What a session for India. 65/8 SA lost in that session. A mighty collapse and it has kicked open the door for an unlikely Indian win. The tone was set by <person>Bhuvneshwar</person> and <person>Shami</person> early on before <person>Bumrah</person> came into his own. Wickets kept falling and even the great <person>AB</person> felt the pressure. No-one could hang around with him and eventually he holed out. There is life in this pitch and chasing 208 won't be easy, but India will be riding high after taking 8 wickets in under two hours.
<person>Bumrah</person> to <person>de Villiers</person>, out Caught by <person>Bhuvneshwar</person>!! Gone. A good catch too. <person>Kohli</person> has his arms raised and punches the air. <person>de Villiers</person> went for the slog and timed it well, just didn't get the elevation needed to clear deep mid-wicket. <person>Bhuvi</person> settled himself under the high ball and took it calmly. Just took a step back, which put his foot close to the ad-cushion, but he knew where he was. Pressure catch and he held on. End of the innings and it will be lunch as well.
