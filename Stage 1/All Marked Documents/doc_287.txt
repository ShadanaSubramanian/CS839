There it. It's a rout really. Sri Lanka complete an 82-run victory, the highest margin of victory for them against the current world champions. <person>Amila Aponso</person> finishes with a four-wicket haul. Sri Lanka are throwing up some interesting cricketers. Very promising. But it was <person>Thissara Perera</person>, who broke the back of Australia's chase with those crucial wickets. <person>Matthew Wade</person> fought valiantly with a half century but once he holed out in the deep, the writing was on the wall. Sri Lanka have levelled the series and this one promises to be much closer than what the Tests threw up. At least that's what we hope!
