The getting off strike with a single to mid-wicket did eventually come in handy for <person>du Plessis</person> in a crucial clash against Durban High School, a clash that saw the Affies boys go up against a future teammate <person>Hashim Amla</person>. But it was <person>Imran Khan</person>, the off-break bowler picked for the Cape Town Test of 2009 against Australia, who gave <person>Botes</person> boys all the trouble. "That was an interesting game in the sense that it was a lively wicket and we bowled them out for 140, but <person>Amla</person> made 73. And he hit the ball cleanly as well that day on a difficult wicket. So, you could see then that this guy can play.
