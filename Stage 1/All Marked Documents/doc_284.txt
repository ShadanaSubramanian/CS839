India's spin combo, which was not to be seen after the Brisbane One Day International (ODI), combined to take four wickets and gave away only 49 runs in eight overs, which proved to be the difference between the two teams. Debutants, <person>Jasprit Bumrah</person> and <person>Hardik Pandya</person>, although costly, took three and two wickets respectively to chip in for the win, as well. It was perhaps a nice touch that the two debutants combined to take the final wicket and hand India the win, with <person>Bumrah</person> having <person>Boyce</person> caught by Pandya in the final over.
