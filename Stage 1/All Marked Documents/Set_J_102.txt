After <person>Shikhar Dhawan</person> 39-ball 72 set up India's massive first-innings total, <person>Bhuvneshwar Kumar</person> five-wicket haul ensured South Africa would eventually fall short of it despite opener <person>Reeza Hendricks</person> commendable batting effort (70 off 50 balls). A blitzy stand between <person>Hendricks</person> and <person>Farhaan Behardien</person> threatened to upstage India's big score, but that was spectacularly thwarted during <person>Bhuvneshwar</person> final spell. South Africa lost five wickets for just 21 runs, and finished 28 short of India's total to give the visitors a 1-0 series lead.
