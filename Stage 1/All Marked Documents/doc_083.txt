<person>Rabada</person> to <person>Bhuvneshwar</person>, 2 runs, electrifying from <person>Bavuma</person>. Phew, he gave <person>Ashwin</person> a scare there. Good length around off, <person>Bhuvneshwar</person> defends towards <person>Bavuma</person> at short cover who misjudges it originally and has to run back as a result. But boy he's lightning. Chases it down, slides, picks and throws towards the non-striker's end. <person>Ashwin</person> was forced to dive, but there was no direct-hit. <person>Rabada</person> to <person>Bhuvneshwar</person>, no run, too good. Credit to <person>Bhuvi</person> too that he didn't chase it. Back of length, angled in initially, but the ball zips away off the pitch. <person>Bhuvneshwar</person>, although beaten, has kept his bat close to the body so he's missed it comfortably
