<person>Philander</person> to <person>Bumrah</person>, out Caught by <person>du Plessis</person> Has he taken this? They're all celebrating, and the umpires seem fine with it. Fittingly, it's <person>Philander</person>. <person>Vernon Philander</person>, what a performance! Full at the stumps, and that curl on the ball again. Finds the outside edge which dies in front of second slip. Superb from <person>du Plessis</person> to dive forward for the grab. It's 1-0 South Africa. 
<person>Philander</person> to <person>Shami</person>, out Caught by <person>du Plessis</person> Edged and taken. Five for <person>Philander</person>, who's still getting the ball to swing - as old as it is. Throws it up for the drive just outside off, <person>Shami</person> is too big of a tailender to resist and he nicks it behind where <person>du Plessis</person> takes a safe catch to his left.
