<person>Bumrah</person> to <person>de Kock</person>, out Caught by <person>Saha</person> India have reviewed for a caught behind appeal. Not given. Hello! Big spike on UltraEdge. <person>de Kock</person> has to go. What a good review! As soon as <person>Richard Kettleborough</person> said no, <person>Kohli</person> took the review and was so confident that he was telling everyone it was out. His confidence has been proved right. Nip-backer on a fullish length, <person>de Kock</person> drives outside the line and a clear inside edge through to <person>Saha</person>. There was a noise as well and the technology gets India the wicket. What a spell this is from <person>Bumrah</person>.
