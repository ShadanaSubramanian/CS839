<person>De Kock</person> took a while to get going while his opening partner <person>Amla</person> started with a flurry of boundaries to help South Africa off to a positive start. It didn't take the wicketkeeper-batsman too long to hit his straps, and when he did, he unleashed his wrath upon the hapless Sri Lankan bowlers, sending them on a leather hunt en route to a 40-ball half-century. <person>Amla</person> too reached fifty and had the Sri Lankan fielders to thank as their sloppy efforts gave him a couple of lucky breaks. Making the tourists pay for their mistakes, <person>Amla</person> provided solid support to <person>de Kock</person> as they brought up a century stand in quick time.
