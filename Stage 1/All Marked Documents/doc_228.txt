Earlier, the Sri Lankan openers, who have struggled to counter the new-ball threat of <person>Mitchell Starc</person>, brimmed with intent to give the hosts a flying start. <person>De Silva's</person> (34) innings was marked by deft placement on both sides of the wicket. He was light on his feet, but just like a typical boxer, landed enough blows to put the opposition under pressure. <person>Danushka Gunathilaka</person> (39) too flared briefly. He seemed to be unburdened by his previous failures in the 50-over format as with a lethal mix of lofted shots and the occasional well-placed leg glance, he pushed the scoring rate along. Eventually, it was <person>James Faulkner</person>, Australia's one-day specialist, who dislodged <person>de Silva</person>.
