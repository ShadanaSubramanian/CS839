Good job by <person>Ashwin</person> there at the end, getting rid of the two left-handers to keep South Africa under 300. It's still a score which is pretty healthy, on a pitch which had a lot on offer in the morning. It has certainly mellowed down, but the real question is whether it has mellowed down significantly enough to make South Africa's decision at the toss prove costly. If there's any attack in the world to capitalize on helpful conditions, it is this one which the hosts have. Get ready, India's batsmen have a job on their hands. We'll be back in 5 minutes.. <person>Ashwin</person> to <person>Morne Morkel</person>, out Lbw!! This is plumb. Dead. <person>Morkel</person> is deceived by the pace of the ball, which causes him to play back to it, and once he does, he's got no chance of making any adjustment as it rapidly slides on with the arm to trap him in front of the stumps. South Africa have been bowled out on 286.
