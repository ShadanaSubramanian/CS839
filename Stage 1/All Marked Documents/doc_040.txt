A solitary six and seven fours were the boundaries that <person>Kohli</person> had managed during his 54-ball 82, which included a thumping straight drive off <person>Malinga</person> that nearly struck umpire <person>Ruchira Palliyaguruge</person>. The umpire just about managed to get out of harm's way, dropping down on the ground after the extremely lucky miss and had a smile on his face when he stood up. But it wasn't a smile that <person>Kohli</person> had on his face a short while later, angry with himself for not finishing the game when he fell to <person>Udana</person> in the penultimate over. But he would have been up and smiling in the dressing room when <person>Manish Pandey</person> half-century and <person>MS Dhoni</person> fifth successive unbeaten knock saw India through.
