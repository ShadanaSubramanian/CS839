Sri Lanka tried to make a game of it when they struck thrice in the space of eight deliveries, seeing the back of <person>Maxwell</person>, <person>Moises Henriques</person> and <person>Warner</person>. While <person>Maxwell</person> got a bottom edge off <person>Seekkuge Prasanna</person> that crashed on to the stumps, <person>Henriques</person> couldn't make it back to the crease in time to give <person>Pathirana</person> his first wicket. The left-arm spinner struck again two deliveries later as <person>Warner</person> found <person>Perera</person> at deep backward square. What seemed like a canter turned into an interesting contest when <person>James Faulkner</person> was run out a short while later.
