Sri Lanka were searching for a wicket and <person>Mathews</person> has nipped out <person>Warner</person>. Australia have made a decent start but needed the duo to carry on in this tricky chase. Try keeping <person>Dilshan</person> out today. Celebrates his last ODI hurrah with a vintage catch at point. <person>Warner</person> was completely foxed here. Slower delivery this, Warner is early into this squarish punch and chips it in <person>Dilshan's</person> radar of awesomeness. A mini dive to his left, and boom, the catch's taken and celebrated with a tumble.
