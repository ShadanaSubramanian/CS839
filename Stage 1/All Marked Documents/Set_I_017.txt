<person>Kohli</person>, India captain: We thought at the toss, the ball is going to do a bit in the morning. Was a much harder wicket than Durban. <person>Bhuvi</person> and <person>Bumrah</person> started really well. We didn't let SA get too much up front. Spinners were outstanding again. To win like this obviously feels very good. What we thought in the morning, we did all those things right. We knew that we won't get grass on the pitch. When it's seaming it's anyone's game anyway. We have the quicks to back that. We knew the wickets were going to be hard and dry. Those two (wrist-spinners) are a handy bunch together. If we set up to chase down totals, we know exactly what we want to do. <person>Rohit</person> and <person>Shikhar</person> intent at the top is crucial. They started off well in the last game too. We back guys to play positive cricket. Small totals, it's always important to start positive. It's a wonderful position to be in. We know their middle-order is inexperienced, and we look to cash in on that. The way our spinners are bowling, we are confident about continuing the same momentum.<person>Chahal</person>, MoM: Enjoying bowling here. We used to play in such conditions in India. It's about how mentally tough you are when you go overseas. When I first struck, <person>Kuldeep</person> came in and took two wickets. It puts pressure on the batsmen.
