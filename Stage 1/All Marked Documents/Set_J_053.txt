Whichever position he bats, limited-overs cricket in Sri Lanka has been a struggle for <person>KL Rahul<\person> during this tour. Be it No. 3 in the second ODI, No. 4 in the third or No. 5 in the fourth, all <person>Rahul<\person> could manage were scores of 4, 17 and 7, failing to come to grips with the spin of <person>Akila Dananjaya<\person>. Back to his preferred opening position in the one-off T20I, <person>Rahul<\person> appeared set to make up for his previous failures as he got off to a promising start. However leg-spin proved to be his nemesis once again and this time it was the conventional leg-spin of <person>Seekkuge Prasanna<\person>, and he had <person>Dasun Shanaka<\person> to thank.
