 Sri Lankan batsmen based their game on the rule of adventure, but in an attempt to go for the big hits, lost early wickets. <person>Kusal Perera</person>, <person>Dhananjaya de Silva</person> and <person>Dilshan</person> were the three batsmen who perished in the first five overs of the innings. <person>Dilshan</person> was given a nice round of applause as he walked back to the pavilion for one final time in Pallekele.
