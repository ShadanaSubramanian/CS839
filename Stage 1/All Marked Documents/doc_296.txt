Despite some concerns in the middle order - <person>Rahul</person> failures and <person>Hardik Pandya</person>  lack of impact - India's most reliable middle order option over the years, <person>MS Dhoni</person>, delivered. While there are arguments that his finishing powers are on the wane, that he cannot rotate the strike or shift gears seamlessly as he used to earlier, <person>Dhoni</person> went about proving his critics wrong. Although the challenges will only get tougher from here on, an altered technique and a new set of pads are the equipment <person>Dhoni</person> has chosen to embark on a fresh journey. If <person>Ravi Shastri</person> words are anything to go by, <person>Dhoni</person> is not even half finished yet. Although that might be an exaggeration, <person>Dhoni</person> still has a lot to offer and India will be banking on him to deliver.
