With the bat, <person>de Villiers</person> was always 'the natural' while <person>du Plessis</person> strived to succeed despite his shortcomings. For two years, <person>Botes</person> tried to change his captain's bat grip - he had a big gap on the bat handle between his two hands. But <person>du Plessis</person> would come back after the winter holidays and say: "Sir every time I want to get off strike, I want to hit to mid-wicket and run and your grip doesn't help" <person>Botes</person> recalls. "We agreed to let him keep his heavy bottom-hand influence, so if you even watch him now, you see that he won't hit the ball cleanly on the off-side. If you see the slow-mos properly, you'll see the bat turning a lot because of that grip. But it's just a thing about finding comfort"
