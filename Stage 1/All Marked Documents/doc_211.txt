14:37 Local Time, 12:37 GMT, 18:07 IST: Off we go again. Goodbye. Nah, we're here. It's a staggering win for India at Centurion to go 2-0 up. Fifty minutes back, it would have felt a lot more staggering, but cricket's laws wouldn't have it that way. We're still reeling from how ridiculous that break for lunch was. But tough as it may be, let it not steal the thunder from <person>Yuzvendra Chahal</person> maiden ODI five-for which crashed South Africa to their lowest ODI total at home. India's wrist-spinners had an extraordinary home season last year, and if there were any doubts as to their effectiveness overseas, those have been comprehensively dispelled in these first two ODIs. <person>Chahal</person> and <person>Kuldeep</person> combined for a total of eight wickets today on a slightly slow pitch at Centurion, which was to India's liking. That still doesn't explain South Africa's capitulation though. It was all too easy for the visitors from there as they romped home through breezy knocks from <person>Dhawan</person> and <person>Kohli</person>. Presentations shortly..
<person>Markram</person>, SA captain: Not the best performance. Today we'll have to be honest with ourselves. Got a couple of days to turn it around in Cape Town. Not ideal. Couple of soft options starting with myself. Have to lead from the front. Have to remain positive now. Started off with good intensity with the ball. We'll come hard in Cape Town. Can't afford slip-ups now. Might bring out the best from us now.
