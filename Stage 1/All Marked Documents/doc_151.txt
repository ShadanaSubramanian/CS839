<person>De Kock</person> dismissal slowed down the proceedings a touch before <person>Faf du Plessis</person> took the attack to <person>Lahiru Kumara</person> and also received a lifeline from <person>Sachith Pathirana</person>. He seemed to be continuing from where he left off in the previous game but his innings came to an end nine short of the half-century mark when he mistimed a <person>Lahiru Madushanka</person> delivery to <person>Lakmal</person> at mid-off. This brought <person>de Villiers</person> to the crease and he didn't take long to get going, sending out warning signals with two fours off <person>Madushanka</person>. However, his stay was cut short by <person>Jeffrey Vandersay</person> when he couldn't get the timing right while attempting a heave over cover.
