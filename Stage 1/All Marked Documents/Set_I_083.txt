They were 12/3 and in trouble. That's when the genius and talent of <person>AB</person> - who the selectors contemplated leaving out for Bavuma, for a variety of reasons - turned up and proved to the world once again what a batsman he is. A counter-attacking fifty in no time, with anything loose being put away, coupled with push and run singles into the gaps and the intensity, attitude and determination he showed, immediately rubbed off on <person>du Plessis</person> who took his time to get going but with constant prodding from his mate in Afrikaans, the duo have won their side the session. From 12/3 to 107/3 - runs coming in a torrent as India kept attacking fields - South Africa will take it hands down on this Newlands wicket.12:30 Local Time, 10:30 GMT, 16:00 IST: Pats, claps and encouragement from everyone. From both sides. How to sum up the opening session of this Newlands Test? First 30 minutes to India. Next 90 to South Africa. Eyebrows would've been raised when <person>Faf</person> won the toss and decided to bat first with four seamers and just 6 batsmen (which includes QDK). On a grassy pitch which would only quicken as the game progresses. Won't deteriorate as much as the sub-continental ones and therefore batting fourth won't be that big a challenge. So all factors pointed to bowling first. But <person>Faf</person> chose to bat. And his decision was made to look a bit off the plot by <person>Bhuvi</person> who took three wickets in his opening three overs to rock South Africa.
