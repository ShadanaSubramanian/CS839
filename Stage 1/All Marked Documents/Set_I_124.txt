After sharing an enterprising stand of 57 for the first wicket, Warner fell to <person>Senanayake</person>. The left-handed opener looked in prime form as he flared briefly by cracking five boundaries. However, just in the nick of time, <person>Senanayake</person> beat him in flight and castled the aggressive opener. <person>Maxwell</person>, at the other end, continued to crack a volley of shots. The way he manufactured room and opened the bat face to collect a boundary off a yorker length ball from <person>Thisara Perera</person>, capsulised his ability to innovate.
