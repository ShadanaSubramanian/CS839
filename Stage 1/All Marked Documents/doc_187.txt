<person>Chahal</person> to <person>Chris Morris</person>, out Caught by <person>Bhuvneshwar</person>!! South Africa have been bundled out for 118. A five-wicket haul for <person>Yuzvendra Chahal</person> and this is his best figures in ODIs. Can't blame <person>Morris</person> here. He had no other choice other than attacking. In the process, perishes. A flighted delivery, that was full in length. <person>Morris</person> slightly backed away to make room and wanted it to carve it over extra cover. The ball turned away and he ended up slogging straight into the bucket hands of <person>Bhuvi</person> at sweeper cover.
<person>Bumrah</person> to <person>Tahir</person>, out Bowled!! Knocked him over! This was on the cards. Full, fast and on the stumps. Simple method to dismiss a lower-order batsman. It was bowled at 141kph aiming the base of the stumps. Too quick for <person>Tahir</person>, who is backing away. He is late to bring his bat down and the ball crashes into the off-peg. Nine down.
