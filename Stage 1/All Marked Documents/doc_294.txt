A few days back, <person>Shaun Marsh</person> was ruled out of the tour after picking up a finger injury, which extended <person>Usman Khawaja's</person> Sri Lanka stay. This came on the back of regular skipper <person>Steven Smith</person> flying back to Australia after the second ODI in order to get rest ahead of a hectic season - a move that received criticism from several fronts. <person>David Warner</person> (106) and <person>George Bailey</person> (44) shared a game-changing stand of 132 for the third wicket to power the visitors to a comfortable five-wicket win in the fifth and final One-Day International at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on Sunday (September 4). With this victory, Australia clinched the five-match series 4-1.
