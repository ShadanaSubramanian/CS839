<person>Philander</person> to <person>Kohli</person>, out Lbw!! <person>Philander</person> wasn't even looking back at the umpire in his running appeal. That tells you how plumb it was! This is a massive wicket for South Africa and <person>Philander</person> has got one when he was tiring and the ball was hardly carrying through to QdK in his spell. A wicket against the run of play you would have to say. <person>Kohli</person> shuffled across and tried to flick this full ball, the ball nipped back in off the pitch and hit him in line with middle. Umpire <person>Michael Gough</person> raised his finger and <person>Kohli</person> reviewed, only to lose a review. South Africa back in it with that wicket.
