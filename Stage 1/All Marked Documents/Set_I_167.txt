Just when it felt as if <person>Glenn Maxwell</person> was looking to rotate the strike with a diet of singles and twos, the power-packed batsman reached his fifty in style with a couple of sixes. The way he made room to clobber a slower ball from <person>Rajitha</person> to compose a belligerent fifty just left everyone gasping for breath. Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to field. The visitors picked <person>Usman Khawaja</person> and <person>George Bailey</person>, while Sri Lanka made six changes from their last ODI.
