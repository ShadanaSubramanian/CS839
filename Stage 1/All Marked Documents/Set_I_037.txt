This is a weird sort of a rivalry that is developing now. Remember, <person>Kevin Pietersen</person>? How the larger-than-life batsman fell to pie-chucker <person>Yuvraj</person> Singh time and again? For some reason, <person>Maxwell</person>, too, is , slowly falling into that bracket. <person>Yuvraj Singh</person> is brought on to bowl and, with a harmless delivery, dismisses <person>Glenn Maxwell</person> who gives an easy catch to Suresh Raina at cover.
