It was only around the 20th over that <person>Warner</person> decided to counter-attack. He drilled a half volley from <person>Perera</person> all along the ground into the downtown territories to signal his intent. Once <person>Warner</person> got into his groove, he checked in a series of shots and composed an impressive hundred. His innings also turned out to be the highest individual score made by an Australia in ODIs in Sri Lanka. The Australian captain would be a relieved man as until this hundred, he had aggregated just 38 runs in the series. <person>Bailey</person>, on the other hand, played the supporting role to perfection. He looked to steal sharp singles and twos, and blended it with the occasional sweep shot. As the two began to play with considerable authority, the hosts were deflated.
