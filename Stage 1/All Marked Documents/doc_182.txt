"<person>Chris</person> dislocated his left shoulder whilst diving during a fielding drill at training today. Consequently he will be unavailable for the remaining matches and instead will return to Brisbane to undergo further investigation to determine the full extent of the injury," David Beakley, the Australian team physiotherapist, said. "<person>Aaron</person> was hit on the right index finger when fielding a ball and subsequent x-rays have shown a fracture which means he will not be available for the remaining two T20 International matches." There was also a bit of controversy in the middle as <person>Kusal Perera</person> (14) asked for the review after he was adjudged leg before off <person>Head</person>. On replays, from one of the camera angles, it felt as if he had eked out an inside edge, but the initial decision was upheld.
