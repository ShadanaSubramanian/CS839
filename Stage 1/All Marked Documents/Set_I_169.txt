They were well and truly beaten and left battered and bruised during the Test and ODI series. But T20I is a different ball game altogether and Sri Lanka were keen to make a statement. <person>Niroshan Dickwella</person> was at the forefront of that and it started with a hat-trick of fours in the second over of the game. <person>Dickwella</person> flicked away a <person>Bumrah</person> delivery to the square-leg boundary and followed it up with a couple of paddle scoops that brought the crowd to its feet. Although <person>Upul Tharanga</person> got out after managing a boundary off <person>Bhuvneshwar Kumar</person> and <person>Dilshan Munaweera</person> kept the attack going from his end as well, cover-driving and slog-sweeping <person>Bhuvneshwar</person> for a couple of fours before taking on <person>Yuzvendra Chahal</person> for a couple of maximums that had class written all over.
