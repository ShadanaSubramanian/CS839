<person>De Villiers</person> had just returned from a 12-week absence due to a shoulder injury sustained while playing Rugby and had to give up 'keeping responsibilities. As it turned out, both the Affies stars failed with the bat, but a century from <person>Kuhn</person> gave the school a respectable total of 203. By 25 overs in the chase, <person>KES</person> chomped down 101 runs off the target for the loss of just one wicket with <person>van Jaarsveld</person> and <person>Blake Snijman</person> scoring fifties. Then the Affies hit back in the next 25 overs, their athleticism on the field contributing to five run-outs. Eventually, the chase came down to the final-wicket in the final over, when a gross error in judgement led <person>de Villiers</person> to drop a crucial catch (he ran backward from mid-wicket while the fielder at long-on had an easier chance). A single off the last ball condemned the Pretoria school to a one-wicket defeat.
