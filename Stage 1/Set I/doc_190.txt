We have one more presentation. India are certain to finish as the top-ranked Test side by the cutoff date (April 3), and <person>Sunil Gavaskar</person> and <person>Graeme Pollock</person> are here to present <person>Virat Kohli</person> with the ICC Test mace. "Having received it twice in a row is a special feeling," <person>Kohli</person> says. "The support staff have done all the hard work. We are looking forward to it (tours to England and Australia). I'd say we are still 80% (as a Test unit). When we are able to achieve what we want to in the two tours, we'll be more content. But our 80% is also exciting. To be a world class side, you have to be 100%"
