After the emotional moment, it was back to business as the young duo of <person>Kusal Perera</person> and <person>Dhananjaya de Silva</person> dealt in boundaries to power Sri Lanka forward. <person>Mitchell Starc</person> and <person>Maxwell</person> bore the brunt of the attack as the second-wicket pair were setting up a good platform. However, the partnership was cut short in the final over of the powerplay thanks to a brilliant effort from Warner. The skipper sprinted from mid off and put in a full-length dive to send back <person>Perera</person> for 22, giving <person>Faulkner</person> his first wicket.
