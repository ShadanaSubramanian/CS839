<person>Dinesh Chandimal</person> (58) played with a sense of maturity, but he had too much to do. <person>Chamara Kapugedera</person> (43) launched lusty blows in the slog overs, but by then, the outcome of the game was a foregone conclusion. <person>Scott Boland</person> and <person>Mitchell Starc</person> shared three spoils each, but it was <person>Adam Zampa</person>, who arguably was the best bowler of the day. On a flat pitch, <person>Zampa blended</person> sliders with tossed up deliveries to keep the batsmen guessing and was rewarded with the scalp of <person>Thisara Perera</person>
