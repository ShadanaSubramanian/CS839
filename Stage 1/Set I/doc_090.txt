"I thought we were 20-30 runs short. Disappointing that we didn't have enough partners for <person>Chandimal</person>. We lost wickets in the middle and that's why I'm disappointed. We could have dragged on till the 40th-45th over. Bowlers bowled their hearts out. Wicket was pretty good. Unfortunately we couldn't give a winning farewell to <person>Dilshan</person> for the service he provided." - <person>Angelo Mathews</person>.
