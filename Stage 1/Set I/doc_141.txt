<person>Bhuvneshwar</person> to <person>Morne Morkel</person>, out Caught by <person>Saha</person>!! What a short ball that is. No chance for the tall <person>Morne Morkel</person>. Right at the head, no time to get under it or weave away, he just throws his hands in front of his face to protect himself and the ball lobs off the glove to <person>Saha</person>. Easy catch and nine down now. <person>Bhuvneshwar</person> produced that from nowhere. <person>Steyn</person> is getting ready to come on. THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!<person>AB</person> has a word with <person>Morne Morkel</person>. <person>Bumrah</person> to <person>de Villiers</person>, SIX, shot. This is <person>de Villiers</person> at his best. The <person>de Villiers</person> we know in T20 cricket. Length ball outside off, he clears his front leg and smokes it miles into the stands at long-off. Stand and deliver stuff
