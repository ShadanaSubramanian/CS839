<person>De Silva's</person> outing finally came to an end when he got out to <person>Starc</person> in the last over, managing to send a full toss only as far as wide mid-off, where <person>Faulkner</person> took a good catch. The hosts ended up with two short of 130, and the fact that they could even come that far was because of <person>de Silva</person>, who stood tall amidst ruins to give the Sri Lankan bowlers a fighting chance. However, his efforts went in vain as Australia scaled the target with 2.1 overs to spare despite the scare in the latter half of their innings.
