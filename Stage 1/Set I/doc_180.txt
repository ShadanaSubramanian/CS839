<person>Philander</person> to <person>Vijay</person>, no run, what a life <person>Vijay</person> is living today. He's not looked organised at the crease, but somehow managed to survive. First he reviewed a LBW decision and now he escapes a caught behind call. He stepped out and tried to defend this outswinging good length ball, there was a sound as the ball passed the bat, but it was bat hitting the pad and nothing else. Great review from <person>Vijay</person>, who went up straightaway with a smileVijay has been given out caught behind, but he's reviewed it immediately. Clear sound, but did the bat hit the pad? Definitely hit the pad, no spike on UltraEdge. DRS saves <person>Vijay</person> again!
