<person>Hardik Pandy</person>, right handed bat, comes to the crease. <person>Philander</person> to <person>Rohit</person>, out Bowled!! Out goes the middle pole. <person>Maharaj</person> can breathe easy. Take a bow <person>Philander</person>. He's not running in, he's tired, bowling just gentle length balls and leaving the rest to the pitch. The greatest thing is he's not bowling loose balls. This was a good length delivery outside off stump, <person>Rohit</person> defends at it way away from the body and drags it back onto the stumps. 76/5. Have India missed a great chance of winning this Test? <person>Pandya</person>, the first innings hero, comes.
