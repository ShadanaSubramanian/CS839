<person>David Warner</person> and <person>Maxwell</person> continued from where they left off in the previous match, putting on another positive stand for the opening wicket as Australia raced away in the chase. Warner was living dangerously, surviving a leg before appeal by <person>Sachithra Senanayake</person> and then top-edging a <person>Suranga Lakmal</person> delivery which just evaded the keeper. However, that didn't deter him from flaying his blade, while <person>Maxwell</person> too lived up to his belligerent reputation. The Lankan spinners were carted around the park by the centurion of the first T20I as Australia were well past 50 by the end of the fifth over.
