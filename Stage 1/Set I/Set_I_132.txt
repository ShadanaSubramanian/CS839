"The bowling department was a bit of concern, not the spinners, but the medium pacers. Even in the ODIs, there were lot of instances where, at times, you feel a bit helpless as to what could be done at that point of time. Because execution is something that is very important. It's the bowlers we were searching for. And when it comes to the fast bowlers, <person>Bumrah</person> and <person>Ashish</person> have done a good job in the three games they have played. <person>Hardik</person>, as a package, is good. He is a very good fielder, and if he gives me the two overs I need, and the kind of batting he is known for - he looks like a good one to have as a third seamer."
