Apart from a couple of failed experiments, it was a thoroughly dominating, all-round show from India in this series. And it was this kind of performance that <person>Kohli</person> was looking for after taking over as captain at the start of this year. "We didn't win three games in a row before this. So from the last game in West Indies to now, we've won six, that's something that we wanted to address, which we did in this series," <person>Kohli</person> said after the 5-0 clean-sweep. At several stages of this series, <person>Kohli</person> had stressed on the need to be relentless as well as create good habits and sustain them. India have done just that. Whether they can replicate this kind of success in future series remains to be seen but what they have achieved will hold them in good stead for the challenges ahead.
