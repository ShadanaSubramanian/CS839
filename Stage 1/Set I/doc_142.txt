<person>Shami</person> to <person>Philander</person>, out Lbw!! Given out. But <person>Philander</person> has gone for a review. Looks out. Unless there's an inside edge onto the pad, <person>Philander</person> has no chance. Hit pretty low on the pad. Three reds and <person>Philander</person> has to go. They lose a review as well. <person>Shami</person> has been outstanding today. Bowls that inducker which rushes off the seam and beats the inside edge, raps the kneeroll and easy for <person>Michael Gough</person> to raise the finger. <person>Philander</person> reviewed more in hope rather than anything else. India all over SA. <person>Philander</person> can bat and has a good temperament. Not your typical tailender. But does <person>de Villiers</person> have enough trust in him?
