Throughout the series, our batsmen failed after getting starts. Batting we have to be concentrating more on making big ones. <person>Bhuneshwar Kumar<\person> and <person>Jasprit Bumrah<\person> bowled really well. They are very good white ball bowlers. They have played lot of IPL matches. They are playing with the world's best players. They have improved because of that. Slow balls and yorkers, their bowlers were very crafty.
"I think that's a balance that we need to create. It will only happen when we have a couple of big series coming up. So if guys perform in that then the mindset becomes different, of taking anyone anywhere in the world. So I think those series will be very important for us to find the right balance as a team. It will be a stage for younger players to gain more confidence and be a regular in the playing eleven that is more flexible. We don't want to be predictable for sure, till the lead up to the World Cup and in the World Cup. We want eleven guys who can bat at any stage and bowl and chip in with overs at any stage. we remain unpredictable and there is no pattern to anything, the sooner the better," concluded <person>Kohli<\person>, stressing on the unpredictability aspect. How that will turn out for the Indian team in the near future remains to be seen but winds of change have begun to blow.
