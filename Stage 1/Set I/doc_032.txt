<person>Bumrah</person> to <person>de Kock</person>, no run, tight delivery on the stumps, <person>de Kock</person> is in behind that, defends it back down the track. <person>Quinton de Kock</person>, left handed bat, comes to the crease. <person>Bumrah</person> to <person>du Plessis</person>, out Caught by <person>Saha</person> That is an unbelievable delivery. <person>Bumrah</person> turned into <person>Curtly Ambrose</person> for a second. Angles it in and then the ball does its wicked things, rears and moves away, leaving <person>du Plessis</person> hopeless, who was lunging forward to defend. A slight tickle of the glove and off he walks. No need to review that one as well. An absolute brute from <person>Bumrah</person>. India on fire here at Newlands. <person>Kohli</person> was pumped after that wicket. Replays show that <person>Faf</person> was taken aback by how much the ball did. His head and back moved back in shock.
