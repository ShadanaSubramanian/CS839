What's the field now? Four slips, a gully, short leg, and a leg gully in. <person>Ashwin</person> is fine and will face <person>Rabada</person> The physio is out there now. Looking at <person>Rohit</person> dismissal, <person>Graeme Smith</person> on air makes a good point. <person>Rohit</person> plants that front foot across - pointing at extra cover instead of the stumps at the other end. Because of that trigger movement, he is susceptible to the fast incoming delivery. <person>Rabada</person> got it spot on and it thudded into the pad. <person>Rabada</person> to <person>Ashwin</person>, no run, my word! That has smashed the thumb of <person>Ashwin</person> first ball. He is wincing in pain and takes the glove off to have a look. His bowling hand as well. The index finger and the thumb on the right hand. Pacy short delivery into <person>Ashwin</person>, who was late on the defence. Rips the thumb and falls safely on the off-side. <person>Ravichandran Ashwin</person>, right handed bat, comes to the crease. <person>Rabada</person> to <person>Rohit</person>, out Lbw!! Given out lbw. Will <person>Rohit</person> review? Yes he does. After a chat with <person>Pujara</person>. <person>Pujara</person> seemed to be telling <person>Rohit</person> that it is better to take it as there aren't many batsmen after him. Looks pretty out. No problems with the no-ball. No inside edge onto the pad either. Hit on the pad below the kneeroll. Waiting for ball-tracking. Three Reds and <person>Rohit</person> has to go. Beaten for pace was <person>Rohit</person>. Sheer pace. Angled in on a fuller length, into middle, the bat was late to come down and the ball thudded into the pad right in front of all three. Easy call for Gough and India burn a review as well. End of <person>Rohit</person> who showed admirable patience and resilience today. <person>Rabada</person> was pumped after that wicket. He wanted that badly.
