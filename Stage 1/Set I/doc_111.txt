While <person>Amla</person> hit a cracking boundary in the first over, the nervy <person>de Kock</person> gets lucky first up against <person>Bumrah</person>. Defending on the backfoot, the ball bounced past him and he wants to kick it away to ensure it doesn't hit the stumps. Unfortunately, he misses the kick and anxiously sees the ball spin back towards the stumps and in fact, it goes on to hit it but luckily, the bail doesn't fall off. Is that the luck that he needs to break his recent duck? He is also hit on the glove immediately and is in discomfort. He is ok to continue but <person>Bumrah</person> has clearly rattled him in that over. A maiden to begin with from the other end.
South Africa sprung a surprise by naming <person>Aiden Markram</person> as the skipper for the rest of the series. Now that is one big call indeed. And the general consensus is that it isn't the right call. He has played only two ODIs and n the second, he struggled big time against India's wrist spinners. He doesn't have a permanent spot in the South African XI and one would assume that he would make for <person>du Plessis</person> and <person>de Villiers</person> when the dynamic duo eventually return. Are South Africa looking for the next <person>Graeme Smith</person> Perhaps, yes! But can <person>Markram</person> inspire his side by leading from the front? We will wait and watch.
