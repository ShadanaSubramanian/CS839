When <person>AB de Villiers</person> started off in an aggressive fashion, things appeared ominous for the Sri Lankans. But, much to their delight, and to the disappointment of the South Africans, the ODI skipper had to depart for 14. Looking to smack a <person>Jeffrey Vandersay</person> delivery over cover, the batsman didn't time it as he would have liked and ended up handing a catch to <person>Lahiru Kumara</person>. South Africa are 274 for 3 after 40 overs. How much more will they get from here?
