They weren't running in fast, but the master that he is, <person>Philander</person> bowled well within himself keeping it close to the stumps and leaving the rest to the pitch. He got <person>Kohli</person> against the run of play and <person>Rohit</person> gifted his wicket - twice. <person>Rabada</person> was too good for <person>Pandya</person> and he pinned <person>Saha</person> right at the stroke of the break. We've lost an entire day in this Test match but this has progressed at a rapid pace that it'll probably end with one full day to spare. South Africa need just three good deliveries to wrap this up. India need to question their batting technique. We'll be back for the final session in a short while...
