The series began with two of the best top three in the world pitted against each other - <person>Rohit Sharma</person>, <person>Shikhar Dhawan</person> and <person>Virat Kohli</person> against <person>Hashim Amla</person>, <person>Quinton de Kock</person> and <person>Faf du Plessis</person>. After two weeks and six ODIs, only one of them could stand up to the challenges while the other just capitulated. It did no good to the hosts when <person>de Kock</person> and <person>du Plessis</person> were ruled out after the first two ODIs with injuries. <person>Amla</person> wretched run against India continued as he averaged only 25.66 in the series with a solitary fifty. His tally of 154 runs in the series was the highest for South Africa and that captured their team's woeful performance with the bat.
