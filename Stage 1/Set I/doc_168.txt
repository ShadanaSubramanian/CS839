<person>Mathews</person> stumped. You know it when <person>Dhoni</person> appeals, he's sure he's got the batsman. Floated out from <person>Chahal</person>, slow and asking the batsman to come forward. <person>Mathews</person> is just millimeters out of the crease and he had no chance to come back with <person>Dhoni</person> pace. "His hands are as quick as they've ever been," gushes <person>Bhogle</person> on air. This was 199th dismissal for <person>Dhoni</person> in T20s. Sri Lanka 63 for 3.
