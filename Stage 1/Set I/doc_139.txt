Welcome back for the final session of play. India will look to remove <person>Keshav Maharaj</person> who's looked pretty fluent after that dropped catch. The slingy customer <person>Jasprit Bumrah</person> will begin things, with three slips and a gully. <person>Rabada</person> to take strike. Off we go...15:10 Local Time: Tea, Day 1 - "Good session lads," shouts <person>Virat Kohli</person>. 123/4 in this session. This game is moving at a rapid pace. India certainly haven't let South Africa run away after that brilliant counter-attack from <person>AB</person>. <person>Bumrah</person> and <person>Pandya</person> bowled fuller than the morning and prised out both <person>AB</person> and <person>Faf</person> respectively. QdK continued the momentum with his freeflowing strokeplay and <person>Vern</person> gave him decent company. India managed to pull things back and end that brisk fifty partnership. Maharaj has managed to survive and South Africa need to stretch their total as much as possible. India will be worried about that <person>Dhawan</person> dropped chance and they will know that better bowling could have given them more success. The South African pacers too will be itching to have a go at the Indians with help from the pitch whenever they get their chance. We'll be back in about twenty for the final session...
