<person>Aiden Markram </person>finally has a win as a captain. He can't get enough of the hugs in the dressing room. Meanwhile, <person>Kohli</person> is in a hurry to get off. Nothing quite went his way. To be fair, what India eventually ended up with seemed quite decent for a 50-over contest. Just that the ball got wet, Jo'burg's altitude took over and South Africa eventually had 15 balls way too many. Whether <person>Bhuvi</person> and <person>Bumrah</person> ending up under-bowled and the overuse of the spinners was justified could only be a question for future science-fiction writers. Stay on, here is <person>Kohli</person> chatting and probably giving us the answers..22:05 local: It's a carnage for the ages, the digital ages. The Wanderers, in the pink of its glory refuses to disappoint. Thank the rain, thank the lightning, thank Duckworth-Lewis, thank <person>Chahal</person> and his foot, thank the sloppy fielding, but South Africa have finally found a way to reverse the trend, to reverse the slide. No, don't get fooled by <person>Phehlukwayo</person> 23 off 5, the game was in their bag much before. Perhaps even during the first lightning break that sucked away all of India's batting momentum. And then when it looked like Miller was getting schooled while batting, <person>Chahal</person> no ball was just the diploma he needed to pass out. And how.
