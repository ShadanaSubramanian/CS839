<person>Philander</person> to <person>Vijay</person>, out Caught by <person>de Villiers</person> You can't survive defending on this pitch! <person>Philander</person> has got <person>Vijay</person> for the third time in this innings. Excellent catch by <person>AB de Villiers</person> diving low to his left at third slip. This is <person>Philander</person> stock ball to the right-hander, the outswinger on a good length, <person>Vijay</person> looks to defend and gets an outside edge. Been strange to watch <person>Vijay</person> bat with his movement across the stumps. It's 30/2 now.
how does <person>Philander</person> do it so easily? He draws <person>Vijay</person> forward with a length ball, forces him to play and then shapes it away late, another beaten. Could have got five wickets already for the way he's bowled. India need to handle him carefully
