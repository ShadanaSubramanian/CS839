<person>Ashwin</person> to <person>Rabada</person>, out Caught by <person>Saha</person>!! Crikey! What just happened. <person>Rabada</person> reluctant outside edge bows down to <person>Ashwin</person> subtle spin and drift. He rocks back on seeing the length - short - to cut it past backward point and all he could manage was a tiny, wee edge which's snaffled by a sharp-eyed <person>Saha</person> behind the stumps. <person>Ashwin</person> has his first. He did well to cut down the pace and got decent amount of drift to outsmart <person>Rabada</person>. There wasn't a great deal of spin, but change of pace certainly worked wonders. Kudos to <person>Kohli</person> for ringing the change for <person>Rabada</person> was growing increasingly comfy against the pacers. <person>Hardik Pandya</person> to <person>Steyn</person>, 2 runs, <person>Ashwin</person> everywhere. He is running, diving and throwing himself everywhere on the field. The captain's impressed and rightly so. A woosh outside off from <person>Dale Steyn</person>, was destined to go to the boundary to the right of third man, but <person>Ashwin</person> jumps into the frame with an agile dive and saves a certain boundary
