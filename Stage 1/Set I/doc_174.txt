<person>Mathew Wade</person> and <person>George Bailey</person> bring up their fifty-run partnership. And now they lose their skipper during the final over of the powerplay! <person>Mathews</person> brings on <person>Amila Aponso</person> into the attack and Smith, who has been scoring at a brisk pace, sees it as an opportunity and takes him on! Unfortunately, he couldn't clear the fielder at mid on. <person>Mathew Wade</person> has come out at No.5 as Australia now face a tall order.
