Having conceded 15 runs off his opening over, <person>Bumrah</person> was fuming and wanted revenge. He got exactly that and he had the batsman to thank. As innovative as <person>Dickwella</person> can be, he can over-do it at times and that is exactly what happened when he tried to reverse-lap a full delivery to see the stumps shattered. But his dismissal did not stop the run flow as <person>Munaweera</person> continued his onslaught and was helped by <person>Angelo Mathews</person> as they managed three fours between them off <person>Axar Patel</person> in the sixth over to power Sri Lanka to 60 - their second highest powerplay score against India. Not a bad way to start.
