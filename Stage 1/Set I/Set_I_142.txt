<person>Philander</person> to <person>Vijay</person>, no run, this is very lucky for <person>Vija</person>. Wonder why he's shuffling across the stumps! That could put him in trouble with the LBW as the ball is moving around! This was a good length delivery from <person>Philander</person>, <person>Vijay</person> missed the flick, the ball hit him just above the kneeroll on the front leg, impact was on middle, it was a running appeal from <person>Philander</person>. He thought it was plumb, looked very close to the naked eye and umpire <person>Richard Kettleborough</person> took his time and raised the finger. <person>Vijay</person> discussed with <person>Dhawan</person> and reviewed, DRS saved him in the end. It was bouncing over. Contrasting emotions in the dressing room. Joy for <person>Kohli</person> and disappointment for <person>Ottis Gibson</person>
