In this endeavour, certain experiments were carried out during the ODI series against Sri Lanka, one of which was a reshuffle in the Indian batting order. <person>KL Rahul<\person> batted at No. 3 in one game, four in one and five in another. <person>Hardik Pandya<\person> got a promotion to No. 4 in one game as did <person>Kedar Jadhav<\person> and <person>Manish Pandey<\person>. <person>Virat Kohli<\person>, in one match, had dropped down to No. 5 as part of the trials. Although these experiments did not serve India's purpose, the rejig causing a flurry of wickets in some of the matches, India continued with the experiments and plan to keep doing that in the near future
