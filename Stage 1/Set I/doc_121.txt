<person>Philander</person> to <person>Shami</person>, FOUR, wow, what a start from <person>Shami</person>. Punches this over mid-on. Lovely shot. <person>Philander</person> to <person>Ashwin</person>, out Caught by <person>de Kock</person> This is it. The wicket which seals India's fate. And what an illustration of the kind of thinking bowler <person>Philander</person> is. He's been on fire today in terms of setting up the batsmen. <person>Ashwin</person> was constantly shuffling forward at him so he initially tried shortening his length. It didn't work, and now he brings up the keeper to keep him rooted. Forces him to play from the crease and <person>Ashwin</person> nicks it behind. Back of length outside off, <person>Ashwin</person> wants to cut, and it's on to be fair. But he just can't get hold of it. <person>Ashwin</person> c <person>de Kock</person> b <person>Philander</person> 37(53) [4s-5]
