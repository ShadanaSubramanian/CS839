<person>Rohit</person> and <person>Dhawan</person> are at the crease. <person>Rohit</person> is on strike. <person>Morne Morkel</person> will open the attackThe South Africans were clueless against the wrist spinners. They have a couple at their disposal. But, do they have enough on the board? I fear no. Let's see how things pan out. Here's <person>Morne</person> with a couple of slips in place.<person>Yuzvendra Chahal</person> - Great feeling, first five-wicket haul in ODIs, it's a good feeling to perform well for the country. There was a bit of spin, so my idea was to vary my pace. This wicket was much better when compared to Durban, the turn was consistent. The captain always backs me, <person>MS</person> gives me ideas, I have played a fair bit of matches and I know what to do now.12:17 Local Time, 10:17 GMT, 15:47 IST: India need 119 to go 2-0 up in the 6-match series. A very poor performance from the South Africans. The openers got off to a cautious start, before <person>Hashim Amla</person> nicked one to the keeper off <person>Bhuvi</person> in the tenth over. After that, it was all about the spin twins. SA lost three wickets on 51. Debutant <person>Khaya Zondo </person>offered a bit of resistance against the spinners, but he fell victim to <person>Chahal</person> trying to play a big shot. That opened the floodgates again and the hosts lost their last six wickets for just 19 runs. The combined figures of <person>Chahal</person> and <person>Kuldeep</person>: 14.2-1-42-8. The chase should be a cakewalk for the visitors, who will come out to bat in a short while from now, as lunch won't be taken now.
