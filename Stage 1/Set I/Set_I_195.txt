With <person>Shane Watson</person> and <person>Finch</person> out in the middle, Australia still were in with a great chance. <person>Ravindra Jadeja</person>, however, pulled a stunning return catch off his own bowling to send back <person>Watson</person> before firing in a rocket throw to catch <person>Finch</person> short. From 90 for no loss, Australia had slumped to 124 for five. And it turned out to be a position they could not recover from. Bumrah, who has been India's find of the series, fittingly took a wicket of the last ball to give India a big win.
