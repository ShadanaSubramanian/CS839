On a bright note, as the collective spirit of the set-up continues to erode by one crushing loss after another, <person>Kusal Mendis's</person> maturity for a 21-year-old would have buoyed the Sri Lankan think-tank. He was the top run-getter for Sri Lanka in the three-match Test series against Australia and followed it up by amassing 174 runs in the five-match ODI series. The onus will be on <person>Mendis</person> and <person>Chandimal</person> to do the bulk of the scoring for Sri Lanka to compile substantial totals. <person>Dhananjaya de Silva</person> and <person>Kusal Perera</person> also will be expected to notch up useful performances in the series.
