<person>Starc</person> has made it a habit of striking in the very first over and today was no exception. <person>Danushka Gunathilaka</person> poked at a pacy delivery aimed at the stumps and failed to make contact. What followed was a death rattle for the opener as he was forced to walk back for just 5. <person>Kusal Mendis</person> lasted just two deliveries picking up four for his account. While the first delivery was driven past cover, he failed to gauge the line of the next one and was caught behind. The scorecard read 23 for 2 and that's when the highest stand in the Sri Lanka innings started.
