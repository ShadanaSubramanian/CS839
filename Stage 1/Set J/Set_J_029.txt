Soon after the win in the first ODI, <person>Aaron Finch</person> spoke about how getting off to a flying start in the sub-continent is key to winning games. He gave the team a brisk start with <person>David Warner</person> (10), but Australia handed back the advantage by losing three wickets in no time. The openers scored 31 for the first wicket in 4.5 overs. However <person>Warner</person>, <person>Finch</person> (30) and <person>Shaun Marsh</person> (1) fell in quick succession and Australia nosedived to 44 for 3. And all that could have been prevented if Marsh had shown a bit of game awareness.
