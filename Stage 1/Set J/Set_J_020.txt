<person>Kusal Mendis</person> (33), Sri Lanka's man in form, gave a glimpse of his wide array of shots to resurrect the innings to some extent. The way he teased the fielders positioned in the cover-region with a drive to send it scurrying to the boundary boards encapsulated his ability to thread gaps in the field. However, just when the duo of <person>Mendis</person> and <person>Upul Tharanaga</person> (15) looked set to up the ante, the former fell to <person>John Hastings</person>. It was a peach of a delivery from the well-built seamer as from wide of the crease, he got one to straighten to produce the edge and dismiss the mainstay of the batting line-up.
