<person>Jasprit Bumrah</person> is the second Indian bowler to dismiss <person>AB de Villiers</person> twice in the same Test. OTHER: <person>Amit Mishra</person> in Mohali, 2015South Africa will come hard with the new ball and even without <person>Steyn</person>, they have enough firepower to defend 207. Sets up for a cracking game. Don't go too far. We will be back for the post-lunch session soon. During the break, we'll leave you with that scorecard from Barbados and some more nuggets! Do stay tuned.One has to praise <person>Kohli</person> for the way he led today. Every move of his paid off and his constant chatter, never-ending energy and enthusiasm rubbed off on his team. Catches were taken and the bowling was first-class. Now up to the batsman to do their work to achieve what looked like an improbable task when India were 92/7 in the first innings and well behind the game. Chasing small totals can always be tricky. Remember Barbados 1997? A game the great <person>Sachin Tendulkar</person> rates as one of his most disappointing matches in his career.
