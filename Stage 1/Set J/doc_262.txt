The home team's T20I squad had as many as six changes to the one that was named for the final ODI. <person>Isuru Udana</person>, <person>Seekkuge Prasanna</person>, <person>Suranga Lakmal</person>, <person>Vikum Sanjaya</person>, <person>Jeffrey Vandersay</person> and <person>Dasun Shanaka</person> were roped in for the T20I and few of them could feature in the eleven. Among these players, <person>Prasanna</person> and <person>Sanjaya</person> had played in the T20I series against Bangladesh in April. The batting order would be unlike what Sri Lanka had in that series with <person>Kusal Perera</person>, <person>Chamara Kapugedera</person> and <person>Asela Gunaratne</person> not part of the team. India will also be up against a slightly different bowling attack than the ODIs with <person>Prasanna</person>, <person>Lakmal</person> and <person>Shanaka</person> being some of the options that Sri Lanka could employ.
