In a harakiri-filled batting powerplay, India lost <person>Rohit Sharma</person> and comeback man <person>Suresh Raina</person>, but also smashed their highest score in that period in the format - 78 runs. That came mainly through a glut of fours and sixes after <person>JP Duminy</person> saw a good reason to win the toss and put the visitors in. In a venue where the ball travels quicker through the air, India began with an 18-run over via <person>Rohit</person> twin sixes and a four off pacer <person>Dane Paterson</person>. Debutant fast bowler Junior <person>Dala</person> pulled things back for his side in the second over, as he got <person>Rohit</person> to nick one to <person>Heinrich Klaasen</person> behind the stumps. The decision had to be reviewed by the home side as the umpire and <person>Rohit</person> seemed unmoved by the appeal, but the show of deviation in the snickometer when the ball went past the bat sent <person>Rohit</person> on his way.
