That's the line and length and there's the wicket. Pitched up outside off, in the corridor of uncertainty, holds its line and a meek push by <person>Maharaj</person>, draws the edge. Clear edge. And India break this stand which was proving to be worrisome.
<person>Hardik Pandya</person> to <person>Maharaj</person>, FOUR, <person>Maharaj</person> can bat. Better than <person>Philander</person> in my opinion. At least has a more aggressive game. This is a wonderful hit. Nothing but a length delivery outside off, he whacks that over mid-on. Picked the length so quickly and put it away. <person>Hardik Pandya</person> should be careful here, should not get carried away, tends to bang it in way too much. Likes the short ball, but if he overdoes it, he could be carted all over /the park by <person>de Villiers</person>
