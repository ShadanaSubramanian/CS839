Barely 15 hours after South Africa's Test series-clinching victory over India in Centurion, the Long Room at the Wanderers is abuzz with activity. It's the launch ceremony of the traditional 'Pink ODI' in Johannesburg. Among celebrities that include Miss South Africa 2017 <person>Adevan Heerden</person>, are Protea stars <person>Kagiso Rabada</person>, <person>David Miller</person> and <person>AB de Villiers</person>. The event involves a small walk down a pink "ramp" to sugary music in the background. By the end of the excruciatingly uncomfortable two-minute exercise, all three cricketers are most relieved to be talking - cricket and breast cancer awareness. Then the topic of fashion comes up and <person>Faf du Plessis</person> name gets thrown around more than a couple of times. The unofficially voted 'most stylish player' during last year's pink day festivities makes a mark without even being presen.
It's not totally unexpected that <person>du Plessis</person> name comes up. He is after all the all-powerful captain of South Africa across formats. But it's a name that invariably crops up in close conjunction with that of <person>de Villiers</person>. It has been that way since school. Since 1998.
