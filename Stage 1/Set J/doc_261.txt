Even after the field restrictions were relaxed, there was more heartache for South Africa as <person>Behardien</person> dropped a sitter at long on - giving <person>Virat Kohli</person> a life when the Indian captain was on just a run-a-ball 11. <person>Kohli</person> hit a four and a six off the same over, and looked set to boss over South Africa bowlers once again on the long tour. <person>Tabrais Shamsi</person> however, hit back and didn't let that missed opportunity cost South Africa too much. He trapped <person>Kohli</person> leg before in his next over for 26. <person>Kohli</person> reviewed but in vain, and exited in the 10th over with India's total just over a 100 runs.
