<person>Hardik Pandya</person> to <person>Amla</person>, FOUR, cracking shot! Fuller ball and <person>Amla</person> idea was simple, to clear the infield. Holds his shape to lift this cleanly over cover. The man at sweeper had no chance to cut this off. Fine placement and a welcome boundary for SA.
<person>Bumrah</person> strikes! This was the plan to get <person>Amla</person> but they have <person>Markram</person> instead. India won't mind though. Always looked out to the naked eye and it's surprising that <person>Amla</person> wanted the review taken by <person>Markram</person>. Full ball that angled into the SA skipper, he wanted to whip it across the line but the length wasn't there for the shot. Gets hit on the back knee and the umpire had no hesitation in raising his finger. Strangely, the review was taken and as there was clearly no bat involved, the obvious was inevitable. Three Reds on HawkEye. Must say that this was a really poor shot. Having got such a good start, he shouldn't have given it away. <person>Bhuvneshwar</person> to <person>Amla</person>, FOUR, nice shot! Fractionally short from <person>Bhuvneshwar</person> and <person>Amla</person> puts it away with a good back foot punch. <person>Kuldeep</person> at sweeper cover did try to get to it, even put in a dive, but in vain
